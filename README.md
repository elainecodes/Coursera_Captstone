INTRODUCTION

In order to tackle climate change we must reduce our use of fossil fuels. One element of the road to net zero emissions is the electrification of transport - powering vehicles with energy generated from renewable energy rather than with petrol or diesel. A question I often get asked as someone working in the energy sector is - [how] will we have enough electricity [for this additional demand]? This question is a complex one, with many variables and elements. The answer lies not only in increasing generation but decreasing demand (through for example efficient appliances) or through shifting demand and balancing it with available energy. 

For this assignment I have chosen to narrow down the question to ‘how much of Manchester’s private electric car charging demand could be met by rooftop solar on supermarkets in the area?’. This is an interesting question because Manchester in the UK is not known for its sunshine. It’s a valuable question because solar panels can be installed on roofs relatively quickly (compared to building wind turbines). And for a densely packed city it’s the main (if not only) solution for local electricity generation. With regards to the supermarket element of the question, even in a lockdown the majority of the population still go to supermarkets, on average on a weekly basis. Supermarkets are usually large flat roofed buildings which present an ideal area for the installation of solar panels. 

The answer to this question (‘how much of Manchester’s private electric car charging demand could be met by rooftop solar on supermarkets in the area?’) can be used by policy makers, community interest groups, Local Authority planners, supermarket owners, charging network operators and others to provide evidence for and create investment around a common goal - net zero emissions.
